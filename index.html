            <p class="lead">A brief guide to getting into one of the Japan's most prodigious animation film studios.</p>
            <hr class="my-4">
            <p>Founded in 1985, Studio Ghibli's productions span a wide array of artistic works, from video games to commercials. Undoubtedly, though, the Studio Ghibli's best known works are feature films. Collectively, these films have grossed hundreds of millions dollars. Beyond financial success, the studio's films have won many major national and international awards, including the Academy Award for best Animated Feature Film in 2003. With such multifaceted visionaries as the studio's creators, Hayao Miyazaki, Isao Takahata and Toshio Suzuki, it would be a mistake to delimit the cause of Ghibli's success to any one dimension, but certainly the visual artistry of the films has been essential. Ghibli's animation style varies substantially as the films find their artistic voice for unique and layered stories. For example, My Neighbors the Yamadas animation is cartoonish as befits the films comedic story, whereas The Tale of the Princess Kaguya's style is more minimalist sketch reminiscent of a traditional Japanese painting, as is appropriate to its intimate and somber story. The images displaying on the screen, be they dipicting a dragon fyling through the sky, or two children surviving in wartorn post WWII Japan, are engrossing and complimentary to the journey of the characters.

            <p>Discovering a film studio 35 year into its existence, especially one with as many films as Ghibli, can make for a daunting invitation. Though these films were made half a world away, in a different language, they truly have universal appeal and should be—and ever increasingly are—viewed by international audiences. I'm a firm believer in putting your best foot forward. Whether eager or hesitant, below are 20 of Studio Ghibli's films sorted by Rotten Tomatoes score. The images are meant to impress the feeling of the movies, while the down arrow button will give you more information on the film. Happy viewing and welcome to Ghibli.
